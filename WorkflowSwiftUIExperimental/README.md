# WorkflowSwiftUIExperimental

Experimental extensions to Workflow for writing Screens in SwiftUI.

## Versioning

Because this module is experimental, it is versioned separately from other modules in Workflow. You should bump its version as part of any pull request that changes it, and need not bump its version in PRs that change only other modules.

Per semantic versioning, its major version remains at `0`, and only its minor version is incremented. Any increase in the minor version may come with breaking changes.

To bump the minor version, update `s.version` in `WorkflowSwiftUIExperimental.podspec`.
