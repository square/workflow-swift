## Using Workflows in your project

### Swift Package Manager

[![SwiftPM compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/SwiftPM-compatible-orange.svg)](#swift-package-manager)

If you are developing your own package, be sure that Workflow is included in `dependencies`
in `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "git@github.com:square/workflow-swift.git", from: "1.0.0-rc.1")
]
```

In Xcode 11+, add Workflow directly as a dependency to your project with
`File` > `Swift Packages` > `Add Package Dependency...`. Provide the git URL when prompted: `git@github.com:square/workflow-swift.git`.

### CocoaPods

[![CocoaPods compatible](https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/Workflow.svg)](https://cocoapods.org/pods/Workflow)

If you use CocoaPods to manage your dependencies, simply add Workflow and WorkflowUI to your
Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'Workflow'
pod 'WorkflowUI'
```
