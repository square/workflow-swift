[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%20License%202.0-blue.svg?style=flat)](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

A unidirectional data flow library for Swift and [Kotlin](https://github.com/square/workflow-kotlin), emphasizing:

* Strong support for state-machine driven UI and navigation.
* Composition and scaling.
* Effortless separation of business and UI concerns.

_**This project is currently in development and the API subject to breaking changes without notice.**
Follow Square's engineering blog, [The Corner](https://developer.squareup.com/blog/), to see when
this project becomes stable._

While the API is not yet stable, this code is in heavy production use in Android and iOS
apps with millions of users.

## Using Workflows in your project

### Swift Package Manager

[![SwiftPM compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/SwiftPM-compatible-orange.svg)](#swift-package-manager)

If you are developing your own package, be sure that Workflow is included in `dependencies`
in `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/square/workflow-swift", from: "3.11.0")
]
```

In Xcode 11+, add Workflow directly as a dependency to your project with
`File` > `Swift Packages` > `Add Package Dependency...`. Provide the git URL when prompted: `git@github.com:square/workflow-swift.git`.

## Local Development

This project uses [Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) and [Tuist](https://tuist.io/) to generate a project for local development. Follow the steps below for the recommended setup for zsh.

```sh
# install mise
brew install mise
# add mise activation line to your zshrc
echo 'eval "$(mise activate zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
# load mise into your shell
source ~/.zshrc
# install dependencies
mise install

# only necessary for first setup or after changing dependencies
tuist install --path Samples
# generates and opens the Xcode project
tuist generate --path Samples
```
