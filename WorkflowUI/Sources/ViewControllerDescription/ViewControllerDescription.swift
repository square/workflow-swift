/// A ViewControllerDescription acts as a "recipe" for building and updating a specific `UIViewController`.
/// It describes how to _create_ and later _update_ a given view controller instance, without creating one
/// itself. This means it is a lightweight currency you can create and pass around to describe a view controller,
/// without needing to create one.
///
/// The most common use case for a `ViewControllerDescription` is to return it from your `Screen`'s
/// `viewControllerDescription(environment:)` method. The `WorkflowUI` machinery (or your
/// custom container view controller) will then use this view controller description to create or update the
/// on-screen presented view controller.
///
/// As a creator of a custom container view controller, you will usually pass this view controller description to
/// a `DescribedViewController`, which will internally create and manage the described view
/// controller for its current view controller description. However, you can also directly invoke the public
/// methods such as `buildViewController()`, `update(viewController:)`, if you are
/// manually managing your own view controller hierarchy.
