# ViewEnvironmentUI

`ViewEnvironmentUI` provides a means to propagate a `ViewEnvironment` through the view controller hierarchy.

> **_Note:_** This is currently considered an implementation detail of `MarketUI` and is intended to bridge `MarketContext` propagation between `MarketUI` and the Modals framework. Use the wrapper types declared in `MarketUI` to access the propagation of Market features.
