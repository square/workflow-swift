/// ```swift
/// final class MyViewController:
///     UIViewController, ViewEnvironmentObserving
/// {
///     override func viewWillLayoutSubviews() {
///         super.viewWillLayoutSubviews()
///
///         // You _must_ call this function in viewWillLayoutSubviews()
///         applyEnvironmentIfNeeded()
///     }
///
///     func apply(environment: ViewEnvironment) {
///         // Apply values from the environment to your view controller (e.g. a theme)
///     }
///
///     // If you'd like to override values in the environment you can provide them here. If you'd
///     // like to just inherit the context from above there is no need to implement this function.
///     func customize(environment: inout ViewEnvironment) {
///         environment.traits.mode = .dark
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// - Important: `UIViewController` and `UIView` conformers _must_ call ``applyEnvironmentIfNeeded()-3bamq``
///   in `viewWillLayoutSubviews()` and `layoutSubviews()` respectively.
