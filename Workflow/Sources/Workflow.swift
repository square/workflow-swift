/// **Initialization and Updating**

///
/// A workflow node comes into existence after its parent produces
/// an instance of that workflow and uses it during a render pass (see the
/// `render` method for more details).
///
/// - If this is the first time the parent has rendered a child of
///   this type, a new workflow node is created. The workflow
///   passed in from the parent will be used to invoke
///   `initialState()` to obtain an initial state.
///
/// - If the parent had previously rendered a child of this type, the
///   existing workflow node will be updated.
///   `workflowDidChange(from:state:)` will be invoked
///   to allow the workflow to respond to the change.
///
/// ***
/// **Render**
/// ***
/// After a workflow node has been created, or any time its state changes,
/// a render pass occurs. The render pass takes the workflow that was passed
/// down from the parent along with the current state and generates a value
/// of type `Rendering`. In a common case, a workflow might render to a screen
/// model for display.
